# 📘 Machine Learning Algorithms Collection

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains implementations of major machine learning algorithms in Python.
It is designed for beginners and learners who want to understand the fundamentals of machine learning through practical examples.
Each algorithm is organized into separate files for easy learning, testing, and comparison.

## 🧩 Algorithms Included

### Regression

1. Simple Linear Regression
- Definition: Models the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y) using a straight line.
- Equation:y=mx+c
- Use Case: Predicting income based on years of experience.

2. Multiple Linear Regression
- Definition: Extends linear regression to use two or more independent variables to predict the dependent variable.
- Equation:y=m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + ........... + c
- Use Case: Predicting income based on age and experiencs.

3. Polynomial Regression
- Definition: A regression technique that models the relationship between variables as an nth‑degree polynomial, allowing curved fits instead of straight lines.
- Equation:y=b0 + b1x1 + b2x1^2 + b3x1^3 + .......... + bnx1^n
- Use Case: Predicting Ice Cream Sales based on Temperature.
